Research on Multimedia recommendation Methods (SSL)
This project's goal is to build a multimedia recommendaiton system using SSL (Self-Supervised Learning) techniques. 
Reason: most recommendation systems rely on explicit user feedback or labeled data. SSL offers enhanced adaptability and performance in recommending multimedia content. 
Objectives:
- Understanding SSL cocnepts 
- Developing a system that leverages SSL techniques
- Comparing the perfomance 
Methodology:
- Collect data for training
- Design and implement a neural network
- Train the SSL model
